  As a young engineer in electromechanics I started working in the field of industrial automation in January 2019.  
  Due to my passion for new and upcoming technologies and my eager to learn, I have been combining these years of work experience with an extend of studies. 
  Here I discovered my passion in the field of **digital twins**, **data science**, **data engineering**, **(industrial) IOT** and **development**. 


  Having done my first customer driven projects and consultancy, I discovered that I am highly customer driven and project minded. 
  Having the possibility to have a good ballance between working independent and strong teamwork is my favorite habitat. 
  Love to speak different languages, so I feel very comfortable in an international team.


  At an early age, I developed my interest in computing and programming. Starting with creating my own computer at the age of sixteen and playing around with Linux, to developing my first basic applications during my engineering studies. 
  After one year of working in the field of industrial automation (PLC), I decided to enlarge my field of knowledge.
  In 2020 I followed the evening class program of 'Big Data' at the University of Gent.  
  Here I gained a first theoretical insight in the used architectures and platforms for big data solutions. This enlarged my interest in this field. 
  After that, I enroled in a post-graduate in "Applied Artificial Intelligence" at the Erasmus Hogeschool Brussels to develop a good understanding of data science, IOT, robotics, etc. 
  
  I have basic coding skills but never really studies computer engineering. To sharpen this skills, I'm doing a graduate evening classes in coding at the UCLL at the moment.
  I am very eager to learn even more in this area.

           Theoretical and practical postgraduate of one year which I combined with my fulltime job. 
           The program consisted of different modules covering topics like Data Science, IOT, Machine Learning, Robotics, etc. 
           Every module was equally divided by a theoretic examination and a practical project.

          **Thesis:** Automation of attaching/ detaching of a combine headerThe combine vehicle was programmed in Matlab to drive autonomously towardsitâ€™s target. 
          All aspects of autonomous vehicles (path-planning, path-following,Kalman-Filter,..) were implemented or researched in this thesis. 
          A CAN-Bus sys-tem was used to read & write the actuators. 
          As sensor for detecting the target,a 3D-camera was utilized. 
          This project was in collaboration with CNH Industrial.
